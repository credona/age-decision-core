<h1>Contributing to Age Decision Core</h1>

This repository contains the Core service.

Global contributing policy:
https://github.com/credona/age-decision/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

<hr>

<h2>Local setup</h2>

Start the development environment:

```bash
./scripts/docker/dev.sh
```

Download model files:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .generated/compose/dev.env -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec age-decision-core python scripts/models/download_models.py
```

<hr>

<h2>Developer workflow</h2>

Auto-fix, regenerate generated files, run tests, then run the final check:

```bash
./scripts/ci/fix_all_docker.sh
```

Run validation only:

```bash
./scripts/ci/check_all_docker.sh
```

Prepare a release locally:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .generated/compose/dev.env -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec age-decision-core scripts/ci/release_prepare.sh
```

<hr>

<h2>Configuration policy</h2>

Project metadata is edited in:

```text
project.json
```

Generated files are written under:

```text
.generated/
```

Do not edit generated files manually.

Do not duplicate the service name, application name, version, contract version, Docker image metadata, or default runtime values in environment files.

Compatibility metadata is synchronized from `project.json`.

Release tags must match the version declared in `project.json`.

Example:

```text
project.json version: 2.2.1
Git tag: v2.2.1
```

<hr>

<h2>Generated documentation</h2>

Some documentation blocks are generated from `project.json` and `compatibility.json`.

Generated blocks are delimited by comments such as:

```text
<!-- BEGIN:HEALTH_RESPONSE -->
<!-- END:HEALTH_RESPONSE -->
```

Do not edit generated blocks manually.

Use:

```bash
./scripts/ci/fix_all_docker.sh
```

<h2>Contribution scope</h2>

Good Core contributions include:

- age decision policy improvements
- stable API contract improvements
- model loading improvements
- safer error handling
- privacy metadata improvements
- benchmark improvements
- tests and documentation
- developer workflow improvements
- release automation improvements

<hr>

<h2>Rules</h2>

Do not commit:

- private images
- biometric templates
- credentials
- generated cache folders
- local secrets
- unlicensed model files
- ONNX model binaries
- large generated artifacts

Model files must be downloaded explicitly through:

```text
scripts/models/download_models.py
```

<hr>

<h2>Release policy</h2>

After a successful CI run on `main`, the release automation creates a Git tag from `project.json`.

The tag then triggers:

- the GitHub release workflow
- the Docker image workflow

Do not create a release tag manually unless automation failed and the repository state has been verified.

<hr>

<h2>Model policy</h2>

When adding or changing a model, update:

- docs/models.md
- scripts/models/download_models.py
- related tests
- benchmark notes when applicable

Each model entry must document:

- model name
- source URL
- expected local path
- upstream license when known
- project usage
- known limitations
- redistribution notes

<hr>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

Use:

- README.md for the repository entry point
- docs/usage.md for service usage
- docs/models.md for model transparency and third-party notices
- docs/benchmarks.md for benchmark methodology
- docs/compatibility.md for compatibility and contract stability rules
- CHANGELOG.md for release history
